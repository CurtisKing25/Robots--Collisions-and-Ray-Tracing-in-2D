# Robots--Collisions-and-Ray-Tracing-in-2D
A progress log of the topics stated above in programs of varying complexity.
I intend on using this repository to store all my useable code.
I will label future files clearly so that it is easy for me to understand I must do next to complete each aspect of the project.
I will then put all of the files together to create a working project.
Last I will finalise it and likely have one project as a single robot and maybe have a versus mode.
